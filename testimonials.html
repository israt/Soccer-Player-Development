Thru our travels back and forth to Atlanta we realized we	needed to get some professional training here in Birmingham. A pare of a another Developmental Academy 	player recommended we call Coach Igor Popovich.	<br/>
                                           We called and arranged a training session immediately. Grayson thoroughly enjoyed his initial training			
             session and wanted to book Coach Igor every time we were back in Birmingham. 			
               Grayson is now at Montverde Academy. The number one soccer academy in the nation. Thanks in part  			
              to Coach Igor's training with Grayson.<br/>	
                            Coach Igor prepared training sessions 6 days a week at 7:00 am with Grayson for a few weeks prior to			
              Grayson's Montverde tryouts.. Then after his offer to be a part of Monteverde Academy Coach Igor and 			
             Grayson trained almost every morning for the next 50 days before he left for school. 			
              As a parent I couldn't be more satisfied with the training and results from Coach Igor. From pricing, technical 			
            skill, intensity of training and schedule flexibility. I would recommend Coach Igor anytime you want the best 			
            results for your child".
